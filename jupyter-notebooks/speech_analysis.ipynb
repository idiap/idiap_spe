The excitation is generated by\nair flow from the lungs carried by the trachea through the vocal cords. As the\nacoustic wave passes through the vocal tract, its frequency content (spectrum)\nis altered by the resonances of the vocal tract. Vocal tract resonances are\ncalled formants. Thus, the vocal tract shape can be estimated from the spectral\nshape (e.g. formant location and spectral tilt) of the speech signal. The speech\nproduced is an acoustic wave that is recorded, sampled, quantized and stored on\nthe computer as a sequence of numbers (signal). The speech signal can't be used\ndirectly, as the information is in the sequence of the numbers. So the speech\nsignal has to be processed and then features relevant to the task have to be\nextracted. The extracted features may be related to the voice source, i.e. vocal\ncords, like pitch frequency, pitch frequency contour etc. or the vocal tract\nsystem, like linear prediction parameters, cepstral etc. In this laboratory\nsession, we are going to learn about speech signal processing and extraction of\nfeatures related to voice source and vocal-tract system.\n\nWe will conduct the following experiments:\n\n1.  In a 2 second speech signal, you will observe that there is more energy in\n    speech regions than in non-speech regions.\n2.  The speech signal is non-stationary in nature, so it is processed as a\n    short-time signal where it is quasi-stationary. In the second experiment, we\n    will select a short-time speech signal and estimate the pitch frequency\n    manually.\n3.  We will observe the autocorrelation of the short-time signal and compute the\n    pitch frequency from it.\n4.  We will estimate the Fourier spectrum of the short-time signal and also study\n    the effect of windowing.\n5.  We will study the spectrogram of the speech signal observed in the first experiment.\n6.  We will learn about linear prediction analysis and study the vocal-tract response,\n    like formants and voice source feature like pitch frequency.\n7.  We will perform linear prediction analysis on different speech\n    sound signals and observe that they have distinct features.\n8.  Although the features are distinctive in nature they can vary, which makes tasks such as\n    speech recognition or speaker recognition difficult. Thus we will study\n    variability introduced by speakers.\n9.  Finally, we will study the pitch contour and the information embedded in it.\n\nThe sampling frequency *sf* of all speech signals is 16000 Hz. Every file name\ncontains information about the gender, speaker, trial number and the sound, for\nexample the speech signal file `f_s1_t1_a` means it is the vowel /â€‹a/ spoken\nby female (`f`), (for male its `m` and child `c`) speaker 1 (`s1`) and trial\nnumber 1 (`t1`).\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["utterance = \"f_s1_t1_a\""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["If you have problems in using any of the functions, use `help` to\nknow the usage, for example\n\n    help(speech_signal_observation)\n\nwill give the usage of the function `speech_signal_observation()`.\n\nNote: The speech files are stored in ascii format so kindly don't edit\nor tamper with them.
