* Idiap Speech Processing Exercises

Set of exercises on automatic speech processing.

** Installation

Create and activate a virtual environment, for example with [[https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/][conda]]:

#+begin_src shell
  conda create -n spe python=3.10
  conda activate spe
#+end_src

Clone this repository:
#+begin_src shell
  git clone https://github.com/idiap/idiap_spe.git
#+end_src

Install the =idiap_spe= package in [[https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/local-project-installs/#editable-installs][editable mode]], so that you are free to make
any changes to the code:

#+begin_src shell
  cd idiap_spe
  pip install -e .
#+end_src

** Exercises

The following exercises are available as both [[https://jupyter.org/][Jupyter]] and [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/][Org Babel]] notebooks.

- Speech signal analysis ([[./jupyter-notebooks/speech_analysis.ipynb][Jupyter]], [[./org-notebooks/speech_analysis.org][Org]])
- Hidden Markov models ([[./jupyter-notebooks/hmm.ipynb][Jupyter]], [[./org-notebooks/hmm.org][Org]])
- Grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion ([[./jupyter-notebooks/g2p.ipynb][Jupyter]], [[./org-notebooks/g2p.org][Org]])

A Jupyter notebook can be launched like this:

#+begin_src shell
  conda activate spe
  jupyter notebook jupyter-notebooks/hmm.ipynb
#+end_src

*Note:* For the HMM exercise you might first need to install /Graphviz/
following the instructions for your operating system here:
[[https://graphviz.org/download/]]

** Acknowledgements

The speech signal analysis and HMM exercises were originally developed in Matlab
by Sacha Krstulović, Hervé Bourlard, and Mathew Magimai-Doss for the /Speech
Processing and Speech Recognition/ course at École polytechnique fédérale de
Lausanne (EPFL).
